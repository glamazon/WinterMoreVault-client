# Wintermore Vault

Are you a live music junkie who tends to have a huge concert t-shirt collection (as well as other concert merchandise). "WinterMore Valut" solves your problem of how to visually  all those t-shirts and other merchandise. You will be able to create a user id and password. You will then be able to create entries for each piece of merchandise with a  date, the artist and any notes you might want to add about the show where the merch was purchased.
