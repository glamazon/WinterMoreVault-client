# WinterMoreVault-client

This is the repository for the client of my fullstack capstone app, WinterMore Vault.

Live music junkies tend to have a huge concert t-shirt collection (as well as other concert merchandise). "WinterMore Valut" solves the problem of how to visually catalog all those t-shirts and other merchandise. The user will be able to create a user id and password. They will then be able to create entries for each piece of merchandise. They will be able to upload a picture of their merch, add a date, the artist and any notes they want to add about the show where the merch was purchased. This will all be presented in a visually appealing Pinterest like cards. I chose the name WinterMore as an ode to Bill Graham the famous concert promoter. In the 60's he created Winterland productions which created the first promotional concert t-shirts. Winterland and the Fillmore were two of the most famous concert venues in the Bay Area (where I am also from) where he produced concerts.
